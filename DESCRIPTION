Title: tools for creating and analysing odk-compatible surveys in R
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "O Milgrim <mlgrm@bigend.org> [aut, cre]"
Description: This package will include tools for creating odk surveys (in
    xlsform or xform), fetching collected data, and converting it into a useful
    native format.  The principal classes are the svy (a data.frame with extra
    attributes and methods), and the svq (survey question), a vector or matrix
    with survey responses stored as columns of the svy.  There are methods and
    functions for manipulating and performing simple analyses, and others for
    exporting results in formats compatible with other software (xls, spss,
    google docs, word, etc).
